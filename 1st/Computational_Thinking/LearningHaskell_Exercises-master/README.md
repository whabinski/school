# Description
Haskell exercises corresponding to the youtube video series [Learning Haskell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn1IOxVplKQ&list=PLHRF-X-NtQR4MZBvm05NshPIEI8ELID5m)

# Instructions
* It's recommended to install Haskell with VS Code as seen in the [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn1IOxVplKQ&list=PLHRF-X-NtQR4MZBvm05NshPIEI8ELID5m&index=1)
* Each project folder contains a file with exercises to be completed
  (i.e. [HaskellExercises01/src/Exercises01.hs](HaskellExercises01/src/Exercises01.hs), [HaskellExercises02/src/Exercises02.hs](HaskellExercises02/src/Exercises02.hs) )
* Replace each function whose current implementation is `error "TODO: ..."` with an actual implementation
* Run `stack test` from the project root to run testing scripts and check your answers
